There once was a boy named Jonny. Jonny lived in a village of 60 people. One day, Jonny was playing down by the river when a garden gnome came up to him and asked him to follow, and Jonny did.

Yes, Jonny was a pretty dumb fellow for following a stranger into the unknown. The gnome led Jonny up a mountain to his secret lair where he held him captive for many years. Jonny became very sad.

The gnome's name was bob. bob used to live in a quite different land from where he was now. In fact, instead above everything in the mountains, bob lived in the tunnels. He lived in the tunnels of a far metropolis of a university known for its cheese curds and mediocre business school.
