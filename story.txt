There once was a boy named Jonny. Jonny lived in a village of 60 people. One day, Jonny was playing down by the river when a garden gnome came up to him and asked him to follow, and Jonny did.

Yes, Jonny was a pretty dumb fellow for following a stranger into the unknown. The gnome led Jonny up a mountain to his secret lair where he held him captive for many years. Jonny became very sad.

The gnome's name was bob. bob used to live in a quite different land from where he was now. In fact, instead above everything in the mountains, bob lived in the tunnels. He lived in the tunnels of a far metropolis of a university known for its cheese curds and mediocre business school.

This school is named University of Wisconsin Madison. bob hated the people in this university because he was never a part of it. He has a plan as to how he can get his revenge.

He planned to put ketchup packets under each and every toilet seat in every building in the entire University. It was a good concept but he did not have enough man power. As Bob sulked about his failed plan, he was walking past the tennis courts and he was invited over to play and he made a ton of new friends. The End!
